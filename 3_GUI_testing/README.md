- Install **Selenium IDE**:
  1. Open Firefox and navigate to the Selenium IDE extension page:

  2. Click **"Add to Firefox"** and wait for the download to complete.
  3. Click **"Add"** to install the extension.
  4. Once installed, click on the **Selenium IDE** icon in the Firefox extensions to open it.

### Running the Tests
1. **Clone this GitHub repository** or download the `ENSF_637_A4_GUI_Testing.side` file to your local computer.
   
   - To clone the repository using Git:
     ```sh
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd <repository_folder>
     ```

2. **Open Selenium IDE** in Firefox.

3. Click **"Open Project"** and navigate to the location where you saved the `ENSF_637_A4_GUI_Testing.side` file.

4. You should now see all the recorded tests loaded in Selenium IDE.

   - Alternatively, select individual tests and run them one by one.

### Notes
- Ensure you have a **stable internet connection** since the test runs on [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/).
- If a test fails, check for **UI changes** on Amazon's website, as elements may have been updated.
